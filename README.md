# JM_Custom_Maya_Tools

This set of tools currently only works on windows. Perhaps I'll make it compatible with mac/linux at some point if I feel inclined.


To get this working, follow these steps:


1 - Add this repository to 'C:\Users\<user>\Documents\maya'

2 - Move the shelf file 'shelf_CustomJM.mel' to 'C:\Users\<user>\Documents\maya\<version>\prefs\shelves

3 - Open the script editor in maya and drag and drop the script called 'Setup.py' in the script editor. Run the script.


You're all set. You should now have an icon in your shelf that runs the main hub for all the custom tools. You can add any tools to your shelf by turning on the add to shelf option.


Enjoy!
