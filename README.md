# JM_Custom_Maya_Tools

This set of tools currently only works on windows. Perhaps I'll make it compatible with mac/linux at some point if I feel inclined.


To get this working, follow these steps:


1 - Add this repository to 'C:\Users\<user>\Documents\maya'

2 - Move the shelf file 'shelf_CustomJM.mel' to 'C:\Users\<user>\Documents\maya\<version>\prefs\shelves

3 - Restart Maya

4 - (Optional) add your desired tools to your own shelf with cmd + mmb

All set
